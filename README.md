chef-mint
================

A set of recipes to provision my [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com) workstation using [Chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/).

The recipes used in this project installing and configuring useful software for machines used for **software development**. Despite *chef* allows you to work with different operating system, [chef-mint](http://github.com/bsnux/chef-mint) is focused on [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com) Linux distro.

*chef-solo* is used for simplicity because we only want to provide one machine. However, you can adapt the recipes to provision *n* machines using regular *Chef*.

[OPSCODE](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) offers a complete set of independient operating system recipes. However, the objective of *chef-mint* is to get focus on [Linux Mint](http://linuxmint.com) operating system, saving lines of code and simplifying the provisioning process.

Keep in mind *chef-mint* is using my own user and specific configuration. However, it's easy to change templates for using your own configuration.
